# Projects-in-R

1)House price prediction

    my first R project and it is a regression predictive modeling machine learning problem
    from end-to-end using R. Specifically, the steps covered were:
    
    1. Problem Definition (Boston house price data).
    2. Analyze Data (some skewed distributions and correlated attributes).
    3. Evaluate Algorithms (SVM with radial basis function looks good).
    4. Feature Selection (removing correlated attributes didn't help).
    5. Transforms (Box-Cox transform made things better).
    6. Ensemble Methods (Bagging and Boosting)
    7. Finalizing Best performing Algorith and Tuning it(in our case SVM)
    
2)Customer Segmentation

    my second R project and it is based on Unsupervised learning using K-Means and Hierarchical Clustering
    
    Customer Segementation is used in marketing to better understand customers of a business and target them accordingly. 
    Segmentation of customer can take many forms, based on demographic, geographic, interest, behavior or a combination of these characteristics. 
    Segmentation for this analysis was conducted based on their purchase behavior, the features to be analyzed were Recency, Frequency and Monetary Value, (RFM) for short.
