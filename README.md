1)House price prediction

    we used regression predictive modeling machine learning problem
    from end-to-end using R. Specifically, the steps covered were:
    1. Problem Definition (Boston house price data).
    2. Analyze Data (some skewed distributions and correlated attributes).
    3. Evaluate Algorithms (SVM with radial basis function looks good).
    4. Feature Selection (removing correlated attributes didn't help).
    5. Transforms (Box-Cox transform made things better).
    6. Ensemble Methods (Bagging and Boosting)
    7. Finalizing Best performing Algorith and Tuning it(in our case SVM)
